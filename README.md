# Automation Testing for Mercedes-Benz website

## Pre-requisites:
 - Python version 3.8
 - Install python requirements
 - Chrome version 89 and/or Opera version 75

### Install python requirements
Once you installed Python, you can install the python libraries required to run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to:
To run the Automation test framework, in the root folder of the folder `mercedes_uk`, run the command:
 - With the default Browser Chrome: `python main.py` or `python main.py chrome`
 - With the Browser Opera: `python main.py opera`

### About the task
 I wasn't able to do the tasks of select “Our Models” - Select “Model: Hatchbacks” and the "Mouse over the A Class model available and proceed to Build your car”. So I started the test, opening directly the website before the task "Filter by Fuel type Diesel”

### Results
The results (txt file and screenshot) will be stored in the folder `mercedes_uk\browser_drivers\`
